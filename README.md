project recipes

This is a project to practice my knowledge so far in html (day 3), i will do this by creating a basic recipe website as part of an assignment from the odin project, this website should contain a main index page, which contain links to to a few recipes, i will hopefully revisit this project in the future after i have learnt the basics of CSS to style it.
